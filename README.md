### Impact Analysis of a Marketing Promotion (A/B Test)
**Code:**
[SQL query](https://github.com/Yael-Hasson/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Impact%20Analysis%20of%20a%20Marketing%20Promotion.sql)

**Goal:**
To evaluate the impact of a marketing promotion (PROMO123) on the sales of four specific device models in the U.S. during Q3 2024. The goal is to determine whether customers who received the promotion purchased more devices than those who did not and to make strategic decisions based on the results.

**Description:**
This project leverages data analysis with SQL to measure the effect of a marketing campaign on device sales. An A/B test was conducted by splitting customers into two groups:
	1.	Treatment Group (Received Promotion): Customers who received the promotion.
	2.	Control Group (No Promotion): Customers who did not receive the promotion.

The analysis includes key metrics such as the total number of devices purchased, the average number of purchases per customer, and the total difference in sales between the two groups. Additional filters were applied to focus on a specific country (USA) and time period (Q3 2024).

**Skills:**
SQL (JOINs, CTEs, aggregations), Redshift.

**Results:**
|promo_group        |num_customers |total_devices_purchased |avg_devices_per_customer |percentage_of_total_sales |difference_total_purchases |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
|Received Promotion |1500          |4500                    |3                        |60%                       |+1500
|No Promotion       |1200          |3000                    |2.5                      |40%                       |-                          |

- âœ… The promotion increased total sales by +1,500 devices.
- âœ… The promotion group accounted for 60% of total device sales.
- âœ… Each customer who received the promotion purchased an average of 3 devices, compared to 2.5 in the control group.

ðŸ“Œ Data-Driven Decisions:
- Maintain and expand the promotion, as it effectively increased sales.
- Test the promotion in other markets to assess whether the impact is consistent.
- Optimize marketing budget allocation, ensuring that the cost of the promotion is justified by the increase in sales.
- Analyze which specific devices within the promotion sold the most, allowing for better pricing and inventory strategies.

### Impact Analysis of Targeted Promotions on Kindle Sales in Germany (Q1 2024)
**Code:**
[SQL Query](https://github.com/Yael-Hasson/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Targeted%20Promotions%20Incrementality%20Analysis.sql)

**Goal:**
To evaluate whether Targeted Promotions have a real impact on Kindle sales in Germany. The analysis measures the incremental sales generated by a specific promotion (PROMO2024001) during Q1 2024 (February 1 - February 10, 2024).

**Description:**
This analysis compares sales data between two groups:
	1.	Targeted Group (Received Promotion): Customers who received the Kindle promotion.
	2.	Holdout Group (No Promotion): Customers who did not receive the promotion.

The analysis aims to determine if the increase in sales is directly linked to the promotion or if it could be attributed to other factors. Additionally, we analyze only the sales generated through the promotion to better understand its effectiveness.

**Skills:**
SQL (JOINs, CTEs, aggregations), Redshift, S3 (AWS).

**Results:**
|device_model       |targeted_group_sales |holdout_group_sales |difference |% increase |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|
|D2024001           |1100                 |900                 |20         |22%        |
|D2024002           |1800                 |1200                |600        |50%        |
|D2024003           |1400                 |1000                |400        |40%        |

- âœ… Kindle D2024002 showed the highest growth (+600 units, +50%), indicating a strong response to the promotion. This model might be particularly attractive due to price, features, or target audience.
- âœ… Kindle D2024001 had the lowest increase (+200 units, +22.2%), suggesting that the promotion was less effective for this device. Further investigation is needed to determine if price sensitivity, market saturation, or customer preferences played a role.
- âœ… Kindle D2024003 saw a moderate impact (+400 units, +40%), meaning the promotion worked but may not have maximized potential sales. Additional adjustments in the campaign could improve conversion rates.
- âœ… Sales uplift varies by device, proving that not all Kindle models benefit equally from the same promotion. A more targeted marketing strategy may be needed for each product.

ðŸ“Œ Data-Driven Decisions:
- Reallocate marketing budget: Since Kindle D2024002 performed the best, future campaigns should prioritize this model while reducing spending on D2024001, which had the weakest uplift.
- Adjust promotional offers by device: Instead of using the same promo across all models, consider different incentives (e.g., bundle offers for D2024001, higher discount for D2024003) to match customer demand.
- Investigate the performance of Kindle D2024001: The low sales increase (+22%) suggests potential issues such as pricing, competition, or low customer interest. Running customer surveys or A/B testing different offers could help improve its conversion rate.
- Segment customers for personalized marketing: Since different devices have varying responses to promotions, use customer purchase history to tailor offers (e.g., offer D2024003 discounts to customers who previously bought an older model).
- Run additional tests in different markets: This test focused on Germany, but similar tests in France, Italy, or Spain could reveal whether regional preferences affect promotion success.
