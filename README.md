### Impact Analysis of a Marketing Promotion (A/B Test)
**Code:**

**Goal:**
To evaluate the impact of a marketing promotion (PROMO123) on the sales of four specific device models in the U.S. during Q3 2024. The goal is to determine whether customers who received the promotion purchased more devices than those who did not and to make strategic decisions based on the results.

**Description:**
This project leverages data analysis with SQL to measure the effect of a marketing campaign on device sales. An A/B test was conducted by splitting customers into two groups:
	1.	Treatment Group (Received Promotion): Customers who received the promotion.
	2.	Control Group (No Promotion): Customers who did not receive the promotion.

The analysis includes key metrics such as the total number of devices purchased, the average number of purchases per customer, and the total difference in sales between the two groups. Additional filters were applied to focus on a specific country (USA) and time period (Q3 2024).

**Skills:**
SQL (JOINs, CTEs, aggregations)

**Results:**
|promo_group        |num_customers |total_devices_purchased |avg_devices_per_customer |percentage_of_total_sales |difference_total_purchases |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
|Received Promotion |1500          |4500                    |3                        |60%                       |+1500
|No Promotion       |1200          |3000                    |2.5                      |40%                       |-

- âœ… The promotion increased total sales by +1,500 devices.
- âœ… The promotion group accounted for 60% of total device sales.
- âœ… Each customer who received the promotion purchased an average of 3 devices, compared to 2.5 in the control group.

ðŸ“Œ Data-Driven Decisions:
- Maintain and expand the promotion, as it effectively increased sales.
- Test the promotion in other markets to assess whether the impact is consistent.
- Optimize marketing budget allocation, ensuring that the cost of the promotion is justified by the increase in sales.
- Analyze which specific devices within the promotion sold the most, allowing for better pricing and inventory strategies.
